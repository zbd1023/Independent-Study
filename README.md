Contributors: Kiyoon Ko, Daniel Chai, Wilson Zhang

Devil's Reminder is a mobile app built in React Native with Firebase as the backend. This project served as a learning experience in cross-platform mobile programming and collaborating through Git. The app's main goal is for teachers to be able to streamline assignment due dates and descriptions for their students to see. For a particular class, teachers can add assignments through Firebase and all the students will have the same information in their app.

Some features include:
- Log-in authentication
- Scrollable list of assignments
- Built-in timer that tells you which assignment is due next
- A detailed view for each assignment that shows the description and a countdown for when it is due
